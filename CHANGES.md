[pull 59]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/pull/59

## 4.2.0

An exciting new feature comes to eslint_d, the first one that is not part of
eslint itself. [Aaron Jensen implemented][pull 53] `--fix-to-stdout` which
allows to integrated `eslint --fix` into your editor as a save action üéâ

Currently, this feature only works with `--stdin` and you can test it like this:

```
$ cat ./some/file.js | eslint_d --fix-to-stdout --stdin
```

[pull 53]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/pull/53

## 4.1.0

[pull 51]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/pull/51

## 4.0.1

Fixes a security issue that was [noticed by Andri M√∂ll][issue 45]. Thanks for
reporting! To avoid CSRF attacks, this [introduces a security token][pull 46]
that must be sent by clients on each request. This change also binds the daemon
explicitly to `127.0.0.1` instead of implicitly listening on all network
interfaces.

[issue 45]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/issues/45
[pull 46]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/pull/46

Back-ported the security fix from `v4.0.1`.

## 3.1.1

As per a [recent change in eslint][bda5de5] the default parser `espree` [was
removed][pull 43]. The `eslint` dependency was bumped to `2.10.2` which
introduced the change.

actually resolved eslint module.

[pull #33]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/pull/33

## 3.0.0

jpsc got the [eslint 2 upgrade][pull #30] started. `eslint_d` will now use

- Pass `cwd` through to eslint.

[pull #30]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/pull/30

Roger Zurawicki [figured out][pull #24] how to make `eslint_d` work in WebStorm.

[pull #24]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/pull/24

## 2.3.1

- Remove `concat-stream` dependency and micro optimizations (Richard Herrera)

Richard Herrera implemented a missing eslint feature to [lint text provided via

[lint text provided via stdin]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/pull/15
[issue #13]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/issues/13

## 2.2.0

Resolves the `eslint` module for each working directory separately. This allows
multiple versions of eslint to co-exist. This is required to support local
plugins like the `babel-eslint` parser (see [issue #10][]). If no local eslint
install is found, the one that was installed with `eslint_d` is used.

[issue #10]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/issues/10

## 2.1.2

Fixes [issue #9][] with space-containing config path or other shell parameters
that need escaping.

[issue #9]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/issues/9

## 2.1.1

Fixes [issue #8][] on Windows when launching in a `cmd` shell where `eslint_d`
was hanging indefinitely.

- Update Sublime linter URL to it's new home
- Add note for Atom users

[issue #8]: https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/issues/8

## 2.1.0

Make `eslint_d` work out of the box in vim with the syntastic eslint checker.

- Add `--version` and `-v` options
- Do not start server when called with `-h` or `--help`
- Downgrade `optionator` to align with eslint
- Update instructions for vim integration

## 2.0.0

This release support (almost) all `eslint` options. Check `eslint_d --help`.

Breaking that API already: The `lint` command was removed and in case you're
not passing a control command like `start`, `stop`, `restart` or `status`, the
given options are passed to the linter.

Also, the default output format was changed from `compact` to `stylish` to
align with `eslint`.

- Document vim syntastic javascript checkers (Chris Gaudreau)
- invokations -> invocations (Juho Veps√§l√§inen)
- Document Sublime editor integration
- Handle linter exceptions

## 1.0.0
